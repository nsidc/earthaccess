## Bi-weekly (alternating weeks) _earthaccess_ Collaboration Cafés

Collaboration Cafés bring together the community work on the tough problems that excite
them.
They...

* Occur on alternating Tuesdays at 11AM - 1PM Mountain Time.
* Are self-determining; you can work on what sounds fun to you!
* Are supportive; _earthaccess_ developers, maintainers, and community managers will
  be present on the call. We welcome and aim to foster new contributions and community members.
* Include live demos on request!

For a glimpse in to the work we do on a typical hack day, please visit our
[hack day share-out space in GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/discussions/categories/hack-days)!

Meeting details (zoom room and time) will always be in the calendar above for easy access.
Anyone with an interest in earthaccess is welcome to join!
