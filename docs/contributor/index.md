# Contributor guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to _earthaccess_! We're excited for your contribution,
whether you're finding bugs, adding new features, fixing anything broken, or improving documentation.

When contributing we recommend:

- reading the contributing guide all the way though once before starting
- [join us on Zulip chat](https://earthaccess.zulipchat.com) for any questions you may have
- searching through issues, discussions, pull requests, and Zulip to see if your contribution has already been discussed
  so you don't duplicate work

Then, you can:

- Open [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/issues) to report a bug, unexpected behavior, a stumbling block in our documentation, or any
  other problem.
- Open [a Q&A GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/discussions/categories/new?category=q-a) to ask
  questions, share insights, or connect with others about Earth data access (broadly)
- Open [an Ideas GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/discussions/new?category=ideas) to suggest
  new features or improvements, and find collaborators and coordinate the work
- Join [a Collaboration Café](calendar.md) to meet other users/developers/maintainers and get help on, or give help to,
  anything related to Earth data access

You can also open a pull request!
Please review our [pull request guide](/contributing/pr-guide.md) first.

If you're not sure what to do, _don't worry_, and just pick whichever suits you best. The community will help you out!
