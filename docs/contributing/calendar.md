### Bi-weekly (alternating weeks) _earthaccess_ hack days

Join from or calendar above!

Hack days...

* Occur on alternating Tuesdays at 11AM - 1PM Mountain Time.
* Are self-determining; you can work on what sounds fun to you!
* Are supportive; _earthaccess_ developers, maintainers, and community managers will
  be present on the call. We welcome and aim to foster new contributions and community members.
* Include live demos on request!
