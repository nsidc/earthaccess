# Triaging guide

With constant influx of new issues, it's essential to prioritize and categorize them efficiently to ensure that the most important problems are addressed promptly. This document outlines our approach to triaging issues on GitHub, including guidelines for labeling and resolving issues, as well as best practices for maintaining a well-organized and up-to-date issue tracker.

## Labeling Issues

When labeling an issue, choose the label(s) that best describes the issue. Using labels consistently and accurately ensures that issues are trackable and searchable.


### Issue Types

- **type: bug**: Use for issues that identify bugs causing incorrect or unexpected behavior.
- **type: duplicate**: Use this label for issues that are duplicates of existing ones.
- **type: enhancement**: Use this label for requests for new features or improvements to existing functionalities.
- **type: will not do**: Use this label for issues that wonâ€™t be addressed or fixed.

### Impact labels

These labels describe what portion of the project they affect:

- **impact: breaking**: Issues that break our public API.
- **impact: core**: Issues that affect the core Python codebase.
- **impact: dependencies**: Use this label for issues concerning dependencies.
- **impact: documentation**: Use this label for issues related to documentation.
- **impact: automation**: Use this label for issues related to the CI/CD pipeline or automation

### Needs labels

- **needs: decision**: We're struggling to decide what to do and the decision committee needs to help.
- **needs: feedback**:  Use this label for issues where feedback is requested from the team or our community.
- **needs: help**: Use this label for issues where additional help or contributions are needed.

### Special labels

- **good first issue**: Use this label for issues that are suitable for new contributors. These issues are designed to be approachable and not overly complex, making them an ideal starting point for those looking to contribute to the project.

## Linking Labels in GitHub Markdown

When referencing a label in a GitHub issue or discussion, it will be  useful to link to the label page to provide additional context and help other members to quickly understand the issue's category.

### Syntax

To link to a label in GitHub Markdown, copy-and-paste the URL to the label by right-clicking [any label](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/labels) and selecting "Copy Link". Then, paste that label in a GitHub issue, PR, discussion, or Markdown document:

```
https://github.com/username/repository/labels/label-name
```

### Example

For example, to link to the "good first issue" label in the nsidc/earthaccess repository, you would use the URL:

```
https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/labels/good%20first%20issue
```


## Close Issue as Not Planned

This section will cover the guidelines for when to use the "Close Issue as Not Planned" feature, and how to handle issues that are not planned or feasible.

### When to "Close as not planned"?

Close issues as "not planned" when:

- An issue is not aligned with the project's goals or priorities.
- An issue is not feasible to be addressed due to technical or resource constraints.
- An issue is a duplicate of an existing issue that has already been addressed.

When closing an issue as not planned, keep the following best practices in mind:

- Provide a clear explanation as to why the issue is not planned or feasible.
- Offer alternative solutions or workarounds, if possible.
- Link to relevant documentation or resources, if applicable.

## Discussions vs Issues

This section would cover the guidelines for when to use discussions versus issues, and how to migrate between them.

###  What are Discussions?

Discussions are used for:

- Brainstorming and idea generation.
- Project feedback.
- General questions and topics.

###  What are Issues?

Issues are used for:

- Reporting bugs and errors.
- Tracking progress on specific tasks or projects.
- Requesting changes or improvements.

### When to Migrate

Use your best judgement when migrating between issues and discussions. Sometimes it makes more sense to open a new issue or discussion instead of migrating, for example when there are many things being discussed, but we want to create an issue or task out of just one of those things.

Migrate a discussion to an issue when:

- A specific task is identified.
- A bug or error is reported.
- A change or improvement is requested.

Migrate an issue to a discussion when:

- The issue is a nebulous idea that needs to be workshopped before it can be implemented.
- The issue is a general question or topic.
- The issue is not specific or actionable.
