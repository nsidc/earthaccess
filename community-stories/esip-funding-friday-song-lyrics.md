# FUNding Friday Song Lyrics, 2025 

At the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Summer Meeting, [FUNding Friday](https://wiki.esipfed.org/FUNding_Friday_Projects) is a way to pitch an idea and win $5K for an idea. Participants from the conference make posters the evening before at a social hour. 

In 2025 Seattle, we won $5K for our idea! This is a short way to document what we did, and to credit non-traditional contributors and contributions. 

## Brief timeline

**July 23: Scoping ideas**

- Aaron Friesz reminds Julie Lowndes of FUNding Friday, Julie thinks of earthaccess. Wonders a low-key way to get input from the NASA Openscapes Mentors. Ah, they are meeting in 5 minutes at a regular Mentors Call, Julie writes a note in the agenda doc.
- Stef Butland (Openscapes), Danny Kaufman (ASDC), Amy Steiker (NSIDC DAAC), Liz Neeley (Openscapes), Mikala Beig (NSIDC DAAC), Michele Thornton (ORNL DAAC) meet during the Mentors Call and scope ideas in https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/discussions/1054; other contributors including Matt Fisher (UC Berkeley) and Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries) weigh in

**July 24: Poster-making**

- Eli Holmes arrives first, grabs some pens, starts drawing earthaccess logo as a first step. Others join, decide minimal text. Max Jones suggests "Growing the Family", helps with taping the word "access" with Kate Wing's white tape. Thumbs up from from Brianna Pagán, Miguel Jimenez-Urias.
- Eli Holmes has to leave. Before she does, suggests we sing a song. "We've got the whole world in our hands"
- User testing: what does the poster say? "access". Ah, we need to redo "earth" so it reads "earthaccess"
- Joe Kennedy and Julie Lowndes start writing lyrics. Steve Young (retired EPA) comes by, asks questions that establish what we'll use the funding for, timeline, and outcomes.

**July 25: The pitch**

- Julie Lowndes shows Kate Wing the lyrics at breakfast, with 15 mins to go. Kate, who actually sings, notices immediately we're missing a line in verse 1. Suggest an addition, and rewrites in larger font for the group
- Joe Kennedy, Julie Lowndes, Kate Wing, Eli Holmes sing. Kate Wing hums the note to get us started, and is a pro at helping us read the actual lines we are supposed to read, and hiding papers shaking from nervousness.
- The votes are in, we have won $5K!

## Lyrics

v0.2

Hello. We are earthaccess. We are growing the family. 

We're seeing the whole world in separate catalogs  
We've got NASA CMR in our hands  
We've got an open contributor community in our hands  
We want the whole world in our hands  

We want NOAA CMR in our hands  
We want USGS STAC in our hands  
We want Copernicus STAC in our hands  
We want the whole world in our hands  

We want a hackday at AGU in our plans  
We want a prototype in an afternoon in our plans  
We want a roadmap in an afternoon in our plans  
We want the whole world in our hands
