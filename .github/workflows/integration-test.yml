    # pull_request_target event are triggered.  This means that without a

    # each event.

    # To prevent this, this condition ensures that integration tests are run
    # in only ONE of the following cases:
    #
    #   1. The event is NOT a pull_request (it's a pull_request_target) and the base
    #      repo is NOT the head repo (i.e., the PR is from a fork).
    #   2. The event IS a pull_request AND the base repo IS the head repo
    #      (i.e., the PR is not from a fork).
