#### Pull Request (PR) draft checklist

- [ ] Please review our [contributing documentation](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/)!
- [ ] Populate a descriptive title. For example, instead of `Updated README.md`, use `Add testing details to the contributor section of the README`.
      Example: [#763](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/pull/763)
- [ ] Populate the body of the pull request with:
    - A clear description of the change you are proposing.
    - Links to any issues resolved by this PR with text in the PR description, for example `closes #1`. See more in [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with details about your change in a section titled `## Unreleased`. If such a section does not exist, please create one. Follow [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/) for your additions.
      Example: [#763](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/pull/763)
- [ ] Update the documentation and/or the `README.md` as needed.
- [ ] Finally, click the "Ready for review" button at the bottom of this page!


#### Pull Request (PR) merge checklist

If you need help with any of these
requirements, you can ping the `@nsidc/earthaccess-support` team in a comment and we
will help you out!

- [ ] Add unit tests for any new features.
- [ ] Apply formatting and linting autofixes. You can add a GitHub comment containing `pre-commit.ci autofix` to (mostly) automate this.
- [ ] Ensure all automated PR checks (seen at the bottom of the "conversation" tab) pass.
- [ ] Get at least one approving review.
