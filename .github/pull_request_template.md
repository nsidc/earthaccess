Replace this text, including the symbols above and below it, with descriptive text about

<!--
IMPORTANT: As a contributor, we would like as much help as you can offer, but we only
expect you to complete the steps in the "PR draft checklist" below. Maintainers are
willing and ready to help pick it up from there!

Please start by opening this Pull Request as a "draft". You can do this by
clicking the arrow on the right side of the green "Create pull request" button. While
your pull request is in "draft" state, maintainers will assume the PR isn't ready for
their attention unless they are specifically summoned using GitHub's @ system.

Follow the draft checklist below to move the PR out of draft state. If you accidentally
created the PR as a non-draft, don't worry, you can still change it to a draft using the
"Convert to draft" button on  the right side panel under the "Reviewers" section.

### Pull Request (PR) draft checklist

- [ ] Please review our
      [contributing documentation](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/)!
- [ ] Populate a descriptive title. For example, instead of "Updated README.md", use a
      title such as "Add testing details to the contributor section of the README".
      Example: [#763](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/pull/763)
- [ ] Populate the body of the pull request with:
    - A clear description of the change you are proposing.
    - Links to any issues resolved by this PR with text in the PR description, for
      example `closes #1`. See more in
      [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with details about your change in a section titled
      `## Unreleased`. If such a section does not exist, please create one. Follow
      [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/) for your additions.
      Example: [#763](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/pull/763)
- [ ] Update the documentation and/or the `README.md` as needed.
- [ ] Finally, click the "Ready for review" button at the bottom of this page!


### Pull Request (PR) merge checklist

If you need help with any of these
requirements, you can ping the `@nsidc/earthaccess-support` team in a comment and we
will help you out!

- [ ] Add unit tests for any new features.
- [ ] Apply formatting and linting autofixes. You can add a GitHub comment containing
      `pre-commit.ci autofix` to (mostly) automate this.
- [ ] Ensure all automated PR checks (seen at the bottom of the "conversation" tab) pass.
- [ ] Get at least one approving review.
